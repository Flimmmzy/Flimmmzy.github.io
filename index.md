### CPSC 120 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorite projects to work on because you had to look at tangible images of real signs. It made the lab a lot more fun because you werenâ€™t just looking at the plain text for the entire lab. Incorporating code with road signs was a breath of fresh air compared to the other labs. 

* Lab 11 

    Lab 11 was a favorite because it felt as if I could use this code for a practical purpose. This lab gave me insight into how I could utilize this code and create a real website based on pizza delivery. Even if the lab was difficult, it was very fun to determine the size and amount of calories in the pizza. 

* Lab 12 

    Lab 12 was one of my favorite labs. It utilized what we learned from previous labs to create a real animated image. The introduction to the RGB scale made this lab more interesting than the other labs because we were creating something that could be used in advertisements.
